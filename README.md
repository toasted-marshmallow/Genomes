# Genomes

This is a small Python script that I wrote. It's nothing fancy or really complicated.
The purpose of this script is to read in text files that contain the genomes of various organisms and/or viral pathogens e.g., SARS-CoV2 (Agent that causes COVID-19 disease), 
Vibrio-cholerae (the Cholera water-borne disease) etc. The script will then count the number of Adenine (A), Thymine (T), Guanine (G), Cytosine (C), and the respective pairs (A-T, G-C), and calculate the total percentages of each of the nucleo-bases in the respective genomes.
